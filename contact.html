          <p class="micro description pad-b-2 text-center pad-b island-1-2">My name is Hayley.  I am a graphic designer from Barrie Ontario.  I am currently attending Algonquin College in Ottawa. Currently I am in my last year of the graphic design program.  I have also done some freelance work.  When creating projects in school, I do what appeals to me as a designer.  Freelancing has taught me how to appeal and create for others.</p>
          <p class="micro description pad-b-2 text-center pad-b island-1-2">I have a very strong passion for branding, visual design, and motion. I also really enjoy a good challenge. I strive to make all of my designs creative regardless of what medium I am working with. I will work hours on end to find a creative solution that pushes the limits and I will love every minute of it!</p>
          <p class="micro description pad-b-2 text-center pad-b island-1-2">I am looking forward to the journey that is ahead of me.  Contact me if you want to be a part of it!</p>
