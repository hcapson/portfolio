My name is Hayley and I am a young outgoing graphic designer, but you already knew both of those things. Some things that you might not know about me are: I have a very strong passion for branding, visual design, and motion; I also really enjoy a good challenge. Yes, I will work hours on end to find a creative solution that pushes the limits and I will love every minute of it!</p>
