        <p itemprop="description" class="micro description">6 Degrees Below Sexy is a lip gloss set by Buxom. The typical Buxom packaging is
usually a simplistic design with dark colours.  The idea behind their branding is to have an edgy rock’n’roll feel. For my box design I thought it would be best to stick with simple designs and make the bulk of the package a dark colour. I kept the edgy rock’n’roll feel but also created something unique and memorable.</p>

          <p itemprop="description" class="micro description">The original packaging was not very friendly to our consumer footprint. The packaging used a lot more materials than it needed to.  The small lip glosses were in a large box. I decided in my re-model, that reducing the amount of packaging used would be best. In addition to that, inside of the package, the lip glosses were held in a lot of plastic.  I decided to remove the plastic and replace it with paper. All of the changes made would help to lessen the consumer footprint.</p>

        <h1 itemprop="title" class="sub-3 push-0">Design Elements</h1>
          <p class="micro description">I chose to use black for the bulk of the package. I also added the blue snowflake on top. I felt this was necessary because this was a holiday lip gloss set. Using the snowflake also plays on the “6 Degrees Below” part of the name. The design underneath the slip cover has all of the different swatches of lip glosses and their names. I decided it was best to use a script font for these names to give it a feminine look.</p>

            <h1 itemprop="title" class="sub-3 push-0">Challenges</h1>
              <p class="micro description">Most lip gloss packages have the lip gloss secured in plastic inside so that they do not move around. I wanted to eliminate the use of plastic all together, so I had to find  a way to secure them inside so they would not move. I created a die line of a small box that is placed in the bottom. The die line is a box with a cutout of the width of each lipgloss. Having the box in the bottom with the cut out solved my problem, and the lip glosses were secured. The paper material that I printed on created an issue because when I cut and folded it, the white of the paper showed through. To solve this problem  I coloured the white spots with a black sharpie. Realistically, the final product would be printed on better quality paper that did not have this issue.</p>
